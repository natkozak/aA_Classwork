#Write a method #second_anagram? that iterates over the first string. For each letter in the first string, find the index of that letter in the second string (hint: use Array#find_index) and delete at that index. The two strings are anagrams if an index is found for every letter and the second string is empty at the end of the iteration.

#Try varying the length of the input strings. What are the differences between #first_anagram? and #second_anagram??
