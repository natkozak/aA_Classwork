"and nil where the NullPiece will start." vs.
"Null pieces (occupy the 'empty' spaces)"

What does this mean??? 
does the entire board get covered in nullPieces?
    and normal pieces replace for appropriate positions?

Yes, in a refactor

OR: does the board get initialized with the pieces in the right locations?

Yes, in a refactor

Why do they tell us to only initalize one NullPiece instance?

do we have to implement all of the movement behavior for all pieces to finish Phase 1?

No.


-----------------------


Do you get back Piece instances where you expect to? YES
Test out Board#move_piece(start_pos, end_pos), does it raise an error when there is no piece at the start? YES
Does it successfully update the Board? YES

NOTE: if we say rooks.is_a?(Piece). Would return true


empty board, one rook
place on the board in the middle
>make sure it has seven potential moves in one direction, seven in another
>place a piece of the opposing color in its way
>make sure the rook is able to capture that piece
>place a piece of their own color on the board
>make sure that position occupied by the same color piece is not in possible moves

do tests again but put rook in the middle

then test the knight and the king

populating with all correct pieces at the end
