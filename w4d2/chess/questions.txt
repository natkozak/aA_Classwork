"and nil where the NullPiece will start." vs.
"Null pieces (occupy the 'empty' spaces)"

What does this mean??? 
does the entire board get covered in nullPieces? 
    and normal pieces replace for appropriate positions?

OR: does the board get initialized with the pieces in the right locations?

Why do they tell us to only initalize one NullPiece instance?

do we have to implement all of the movement behavior for all pieces to finish Phase 1?



TODOS:
change @grid in initialize to self
implement the array constants in the modules
